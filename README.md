# Gap-app

Gap helps you focus on things you need to work on today and/or to limit your
focus to specific Goals.

## Goal

A goal can be a lot. It can be a project that needs completion. It can be a
personal project. It can be something you want to achieve (e.g. lose weight,
exercise more or something that you're planning such as a vacation.

Goals consist of sub goals, tasks and resources.

## Task

A task is something that needs to be done eventually. It can have a deadline
and a priority.

A task can expire which means it no longer has to be done. E.g. no need to
shop for christmas gifts anymore in january.

A task can also repeat itself. This can be very strict, for example you need
to file your taxes each year. It can also be more flexibel, for example 6 months after the previous iteration was completed. If you're 4 months late for your
periodical 6-month coffee machine cleaning, there's no need to do it again
in two months.

## Resource

Gap helps you organize and collect things related to your goals. This can be
notes, secrets, links (to webpages, video's, etc). Resources usually do not
expire.
