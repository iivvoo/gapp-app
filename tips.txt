<iivvoo> what's the correct way to update a package using ember-cli? Speficially ember-data
<iivvoo> I see it listed in both package.json and bower.json
<locks> iivvoo: open bower.json, update to the version you want
<locks> run bower install
<chillan> iivvoo: npm-check-updates and bower list are what I use
